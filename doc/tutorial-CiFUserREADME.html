<h3>Where to Download</h3>

CiF.js is not actually available for download currently. Sorry! We're just handing it out to our friends for the time being.

<h3>What you Get</h3>

In addition to documentation, such as what you're reading now, and an amazing CiF Tool, invaluable for both authoring and testing, you'll find a little file called <b>cif.js</b>. This file is everything that you'll need to make use of all of the wonders of CiF in your game!

<h3>How to Include CiF in a Project Of Your Own </h3>

Right now we are expecting cif.js to be used in web-based projects. To start using CiF, simply make a new .html file (let's call it test.html) in the same directory that you downloaded cif.js to, and fill it with the following lines

<pre> 
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
	&lt;title&gt;My great CiF powered project!&lt;/title&gt;
	&lt;script src="cif.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
	Hello, world!
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

If you're going to be working with files from your local machine, you'll going to have to set up a local server first. If you do not do this, javascript will complain about cross domain compatability, which is a security issue. To resolve this, open up a console and navigate to the directory that you have downloaded cif.js to, and type the following line:

<pre>
	python -m SimpleHTTPServer
</pre>

After doing this, you'll want to open up your favorite web browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, and navigate to this URL:

<pre>
	http://localhost:8000/test.html
</pre>

This is where your super fun game will be, once you make it!

<h3>Using CiF: Basic Setup</h3>

The very first thing you'll want to do is to initialize cif. Thanks to the script tag that you used to include cif.js, you should now have access to a nifty little cif interface object that will have every cif related function you could ever need. Because CiF is a little large, we're going to wrap our use of it in an event listener to make sure we don't use it before it fully loads.

So, to initialize CiF, you'll want to write the following:

<pre>
&lt;script&gt;
	document.addEventListener('cifLoaded', function (e) {
		var loadResult = cif.init();
		console.log(loadResult);
	}, false);
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

This won't be too incredibly flashy, but if you look at your test.html page in your web browser, and open up the Javascript Console (in Chrome, this can be accessed by clicking on the "Three Horizontal Bars" in the upper right hand corner of the window, hovering your mouse over the "more tools" option that appears, and then selecting the JavaScript console option that appears from there), you should see a little message that says "ok."

Congratulations, you have officially initialized CiF!

However, in order to really get mileage out of CiF, you'll have to give it some material to work with. You'll want to specify a <b>social schema</b> that defines the <i>stuff</i> that makes up your characters and their connections to each other (things like character traits, or types of relationships). You'll have to specify some <b>characters</b> to live in your social world. It might be good to give CiF a few <b>volition rules</b> and <b>trigger rules</b> to help characters form volitions for how to they want to change the social state. And then, finally, specifying some <b>actions</b> will give your characters a way to actually enact the changes they hope for on the social state.

You'll want each of these things, your <b>schema, characters, volition rules, trigger rules, and actions</b> to each be stored in their own json file. You'll load them up into CiF in a very similar manner to how we initialized the system. Expand the above script tag so that it looks like this:
<pre> 
&lt;script&gt;
	document.addEventListener('cifLoaded', function (e) {
		var loadResult = cif.init();
		console.log(loadResult);

		var rawSchema = cif.loadFile("schema.json");
		var schema = cif.loadSocialStructure(rawSchema);

		var rawCast = cif.loadFile("cast.json");
		var cast = cif.addCharacters(rawCast);

		var rawRules = cif.loadFile("testTrigger.json");
		console.log(rawRules);
		var ids = cif.addRules(rawRules);
		console.log("ids", ids);
		ids = cif.addRules(cif.loadFile("samsVolition.json"));
		console.log("ids2", ids);

		var rawActions = cif.loadFile("actions.json");
		var actions = cif.addActions(rawActions);

		console.log("schema", schema);
		console.log("cast", cast);

		console.log("actions", actions);
	}, false);
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Using CiF: How to Figure Out What Characters Want To Do</h3>

So, great! You've fleshed out CiF with characters and volition rules. Now you want to see what the characters want to do with each other! The way you would do that is with a call like this:

<pre>
	var storedVolitions = cif.calculateVolition(cast);
</pre>

This will calculate all of the volitions between all possible pairs of characters specified in the cast array you pass in to the calculateVolitions function. So, if your cast consisted of the characters "Abe", "Bill", and "Cassie", stored volitions would have information about what Abe wants to do towards Bill, what Abe wants to do towards Cassie, what Bill wants to do towards Abe, what Bill wants to do towards Cassie, and so on. To actually see what those volitions are, you would call:

<pre>
	var firstVolition = storedVolitions.getFirst("Bill", "Abe");
</pre>

This returns the highest scored volition that Bill has for Abe. But depending on how you've authored your system, it is quite possible that Bill has more than just one volition. You can see the second-most highest rated volition with a call to "getNext" like so:

<pre>
	var volition = storedVolitions.getNext("Bill", "Abe");
</pre>

<h3>Using CiF: Making Characters do Things </h3>

Knowing the volitions of the characters is a good first step, but wouldn't it be nice if the characters had the ability to change the world around them? This is where actions come into play! To see the actions a character wants to take towards another, you can use the following command:

<pre>
	var action = cif.getAction("bill", "abe", storedVolitions, cast);
</pre>

This will get you an action object, filled with interesting information, such as the name of the action. Another useful field to know is action.effects -- this contains information describing how the world should change when this action is performed. In order to actually enact those changes, you'll want to have something like this:

<pre>
	for(var i = 0; i < action.effects.length; i += 1){
		cif.set(action.effects[i]);
	}
</pre>

This will either add, remove, or edit an entry from the Social Facts Database (SFDB). The world is now changed forever!

<h3>Using CiF: Completing the Loop</h3>

Just because the SFDB has been changed, the character's still have their lingering volitions from the previous state of the world. However, to fix that, all you need is a simple call to calculate volitions once again!

<pre>
	storedActions = cif.calculateVolitions(cast);
</pre>

And Ta-Da! Whatever effects the previous action had on the state of the world is now going to influence all of the characters' future actions!

Depending on your game, you also may want to put in a call to advance CiF's current time step. You can do this by simply calling:

<pre>
	cif.setupNextTimeStep();
</pre>

<h3>Key Terms and Properties</h3>

<h4>Schema</h4>
<p>
The social schema is the social 'stuff' of your world, the raw material that your characters will keep track of and reason about to determine what actions to take. Let's take a moment to talk about the possible values of the various attributes of your schema. A schema in the wild might look like this:

<p>
	<pre>
"class": "feeling",
"isBoolean": false,
"directionType": "directed",
"types": ["affinity", "attraction"],
"defaultValue": 0,
"minValue": 0,
"maxValue": 100,
"allowIntent": true,
"duration": 6
</pre>
<p>
Let's go through each of these attributes and discuss what they represent, and the possible values that you can use for each of them. The order that the properties are defined in should not matter.

<p>
<b>class</b> -- <i>Possible Values: <b>any lower case string</b></i>

<p>
This will simply be a descriptive string that lets you know the social phenomenon you are caputuring with this object. Example class names might be "relationship", "mood", or "character trait", but you can come up with any name for class that you like.

<p>
<b>types</b> -- <i>Possible Values: <b>an array of any number of lower case strings</b></i>

<p>
This is an array representing the names of specific instances of the class you defined. So, for example, if your class was "relationship" then possible types might be ["friends", "enemies", "dating"]. If your class was "mood" then some types that might make sense could be ["happy", "sad", "jealous", "angry"]. Again, there is nothing sacred about the types that you use--feel free to name them anything you want!

<p>
<b>isBoolean</b> -- <i>Possible Values: <b>true</b> and <b>false</b></i>

<p>
Specifies if this bit of social state is something that is either on or off (true) or something that is represented by a scalar (false). You might say that you would want a relationship class to be boolean (i.e., either people are or are not friends, there is no in between). If you had a concept of affinity, however, you might prefer for that to be a scalar (e.g., I like you with a score of 90, which is a lot more than 20 but not quite as much as 100).

<p>
<b>directionType</b> -- <i>Possible Values: <b>directed</b> and <b>undirected</b> and <b>reciprocal</b></i>

<p>
You can imagine that some of the bits of social state pertain to a single character, while others describe a relationship between two characters. The directionType attribute is how you can specify if what you are defining pertains to one or two characters, and if two, if it is reciprocated or not.

<p>
<i>undirected</i> should be used if you are describing something that only pertains to a single character. If you had a "character trait" class, with types such as "humble", "greedy", "rash", and "intelligent", you would likely want this class to be 'undirected' as all of these things would likely only apply to a single character.

<p>
<i>directed</i> is meant to be used to describe relationships that involve two people that are not (necessarily) reciprocal. Lets say you had a "directed feelings" class, with types such as "has a crush on", "angry at", and "jealous of" -- all of these would involve two characters; the person with the "directed mood" and the subject of thier feelings (i.e., the person they are angry at or jealous of). It's possible for classes with a directionType of directed to still be reciprocated (Bob can be jealous of Abe and Abe can be jealous of Bob concurrently), but either of them are allowed to harbor this feeling of jealously independant of the feelings of the other.

<p>
<i>reciprocal</i> is meant to describe relationshps between two people that are mutually agreed upon. Let's say you had a class called "family bond" with the types "siblings", "immediate family", "married", and "unrelated" and let's imagine that Bob and Abe are unrelated (and have the relationship "unrelated" saying as much). Now, if Abe ends up marrying Bob's sister, Carla, we're going to want to update the social structure of this family quite a bit! We'll need to make Abe and Carla married, and remove the 'unrelated' relationship from Abe and Bob. When you add or delete a social fact pertaining to something which is reciprocal, adjusting it for one person will automatically adjust it for the other as well (i.e. making Abe married to Carla is functionally exactly the same as making Carla married to Abe; you don't have to manually do it for both). 

<p>
This is the key difference between reciprocal and directed; if marriage was marked as being directed, specifying Abe being married to Carla would *not* automatically make Carla married to Abe. If you are designing a social world revolving around a comedy of errors, you might very well desire for two characters to have contrasting views on the current state of their nuptials. This is one reason why there is no single "correct way" to author; the directionType that you use only has to make sense to you as an author.

<p>
<b>minValue</b> -- <i>Only used if <b>isBoolean</b> is </b>false</b></i>

<p>
This should be an integer that specifies the lowest value a scalar social fact can reach. If something happens that would bring the number lower than this specified minimum value, it will clamp to the value of minValue.

<p>
<b>maxValue</b> -- <i>Only used if <b>isBoolean</b> is </b>false</b></i>
	
<p>	
This should be an integer that specifies the largest value a scalar social fact can reach. If something happens that would bring the number higher than this specified maximum value, it will calmp to the value of maxValue.

<p>
<b>allowIntent</b> -- <i>Possible values: <b>true</b> and <b>false</b></i>

<p>
Much of what CiF affords the user is allowing characters to form volitions over various intents. An intent is some way that the social space can change. So, for example, an intent might be for two characters to gain the relationship 'married', or for one character to raise an affinity attribute towards another. The allowIntent property is what allows you to specify which social facts characters are able to form volitions over, and which ones they are not.

<p>
Using some of the above examples, if we had the class relationship with types 'freinds', 'enemies', and 'dating', this is likely a class that would have allowIntent set to true -- it seems reasonable that you would want characters to take actions with the goals of creating friendships and starting to date each other. Conversely, the 'character trait' class (with types such as "humble", "greedy", "intelligent", etc.) might not make as much sense; characters don't go out of their way to become greedy or humble; they just naturally are.

<p>
Even if a class of social facts has allowIntent equal to false, it doesn't mean that they have to be immutable; people are welcome to evolve or remain stubborn in your world as much as you'd like. Scrooge never had the intent to stop being greedy; he naturally abandonded that trait as a result of the interventions of the spirits and his subsequent actions Christmas morning. The very same could happen in a system of your own design!

<p>
Or heck, maybe you *do* want character traits to be something that characters can form volitions over, and that's just fine too. You're welcome to design it in any way you see fit.

<p>
<b>defaultValue</b> <i>Possible values change based on vaue of isBoolean. If isBoolean is true, possible values are <b>true</b> and <b>false</b>. If isBoolean is false, possible values are integer numbers within the range specified by <b>minValue</b> and <b>maxValue</b></i>

<p>
This is the default value of the social fact. That is to say, if the social fact hasn't been explcitly specified yet, what should CiF assume the value to be.

<p>
<b>duration</b>

<p>
Specifies the amount of time that a certain social fact in the database should exist before reverting back to its default value. Time is a construct that will likely be handled differently from game to game, but imagine you are making a game where every turn the timestep is advanced by one. This is meant to capture fleeting social facts. For example, Abe may be angry at Bob for a few turns, but if the default attitude in this world is for characters to not be angry at each other, and nothing is done to renew Abe's anger, it will evetually fade away (e.g., the social fact representing that Abe is angry at Bob will eventually change from true to false).

<p>
If duration is unspecified, then changes to the social state are permament until explicitly removed.

<p>
<i>Special case: duration of 0</i> -- If you specify something as having a duration of 0, then CiF will treat it slightly differently. Namely, the fact will enter the social facts database for exactly one timestep (i.e., the timestep that it happened), but instead of reverting to its default on the subsequent timestep, it is instead not re-entered into the database at all. 

<p>
This special case is essentially allowing CiF, and the social facts database, to dabble in some mixing of metaphor. In general, the database holds state information. However, by specifying a class as having a duration of 0, you essentially mark it as not being <i>state</i> information, but rather an <i>event.</i> This can be very useful if you want to reason over things such as "did a character do something embarrassing" (as opposed to the subtly different "was a character ever embarrassed"). 

<h4>Actions</h4>

At a high level, you'll be defining an action graph (or, in many cases, multiple action graphs). The graph will look a little bit like a tree, with a starting 'root' node that will specify which intent the action graph is associated with. The graph is made up of 'non-terminal' and 'terminal' nodes -- the non terminal nodes will be used to determine whether or not this branch of the graph is appropriate (though conditions), and if it is appropriate, how desirable a path it is to take and for which characters (through influence rules). Eventually, the graph will end at a 'terminal node' which will have effects defined which will alter the social state.

The rest of this section goes into more detail of the above process, starting with a skeleton of an action graph.

<p>

	When defining an action graph, it'll look something like this:
	<pre>
	"actions" : [
		{
			"name" : "",
			"intent" : {},
			"conditions" : [],
			"influenceRules" : [],
			"leadsTo" : [],
			"effects" : [],
			"isAccept" : boolean
		}
   ]
</pre>
<p>
That is to say, you'll have an array of action objects, where each object has a variety of properties.
<p>
Let's go through each one of these properties one by one, shall we?
<p>
<b>name</b>
<p>
Simply a string that represents the 'name' of this action -- you can call it anything you want!
<p>
<b>intent</b>
<p>
Every action is tied to one intent, and intents are defined in the schema file. An intent refers to the type of ways that a character can have a volition to change the social state (so, for example, an intent might be for two characters to start dating, or for a character to distance themselves from another).
<p>

An example intent would be:
<pre>
"class" : "relationship",
"type"  : "involved with",
"intentDirection" : true,
"first" : "initiator",
"second" : "responder"
</pre>
<p>
Where class and type are terms that are defined in your schema. 

<p>
First and second for intents need to be "initiator" and "responder" (we'll see examples of other names being used in the first and second fields of other actions, but the intent should have the initiator (i.e. the person doing the intent) and a responder (the person the initiator is doing the intent towards).

<p>
intentDirection, is the least intuitive. What it's trying to get at is whether this is an intent to START dating or STOP dating. To RAISE affinity or LOWER affinity. An intent direction of "true" is referring to 'positive' things (e.g, START dating, RAISE affinity), and an intent dirction of "false" is referring to 'negative' things (e.g., STOP dating, LOWER affinity).

<p>
<b>conditions</b>

<p>
This is an array of predicates specifying what NEEDS to be true in order for this action to be considered for this particular set of characters. In general, predicates take the form of looking like this:

<pre>
"class" : "trait",
"type"	: "lucky",
"first" : "luckyGuy",
"value" : true
</pre>

<p>
Once again, class and type are things defined in your schema. Depending on the class, there may or may not be two people involved. In this example, there is only one person involved, so the 'first' field is filled in, but there is no 'second' field -- this is because we defined in our schema that "trait" is something that only applies to a single person. If we were dealing with something like, say, "relationship", then we would want there to be a "second" field in this predicate as well.  Value is what we are actually looking for in the sfdb, so in this case, we are checking to see if there exists an instance where there is a character who DOES have the trait lucky (i.e., a character with lucky = true in the sfdb).

<p>
If we weren't dealing with a boolean class, then the value would be a number, and there would also be an 'operator' field that could have "<", ">" or "=" -- that would essentially us be saying that in the sfdb, some character has to have a value greater than, less than, or equal to whatever number is specified in the value field, respectively.

<p>
Note that we use the word "luckyGuy" here -- lucky guy is just an arbitrary string -- you can type whatever the heck you want. But now at this point in the action selection process, luckyGuy has now been 'bound' to a specific character, and specifically characters that are NOT the initiator and responder. Later on down the chain, we can reference luckyGuy again, and we'll be able to do so with confidence that they do, in fact, have the trait lucky (because otherwise they wouldn't have passed this current action that we're on right now). It's also possible that there are MULTIPLE characters that would qualify to be 'luckyGuy', and we actually keep track of all of them; ultimately we'll only pick one, and not just ANY one! We'll pick the BEST luckyGuy! And we'll do that in part by taking a look at...

<p>
<b>influenceRules</b>

<p>
These influence rules serve two functions: one -- they help us determine if one 'branch' down these action graph is prefereable over another, AND they help us determine if any particular binding of characters is better than another.

<p>
The structure of an influence rule would look like this:
<pre>
{
  "name": "Happy people are more inclined to do pickuplines.",
  "conditions": [
	{
		"class" : "status",
		"type" : "happy",
		"first" : "initiator",
		"value" : true
	}
  ],
"weight" : 542
}
</pre>

<p>
Even though the json-nature of this looks a little ugly, hopefully none of these fields seem too surprising.<br>
-The "name" is a natural language note to yourself to remind yourself what the rule is talking about.<br>
-The "conditions" is an array of predicates, and we talked about the structure of predicates above. These are the things that have to be true for this influence rule to fire. And note that you can use the same "binding names" in these influence rules as you've defined in the conditions of the actions leading up to this action (so in this example,  we could use 'luckyGuy' in the first or second slot of the predicates in these influence rules, as well as initiator and responder)<br>
-The "weight" is how much more likely this action (or, if we're not yet at a 'terminal', this 'branch' in the action graph) is going to be. This number could also be negative, making this branch/action LESS likely.

<p>
<b>leadsTo</b>

<p>
This is simply an array of strings saying what this node in the graph points to -- the strings are the "name" field of the other actions. We've talked about the idea of "non terminal" actions and "terminal" actions -- if the action is terminal, then there should NOT be a LEADS TO field defined.

<p>
<b>effects</b>
<p>
These are the CHANGES to the social state that should be made if this action is taken, and these are, once again, just simply an array of predicates.

<p>
As it is currently implemented, Effects should only be defined for terminal actions.

<p>
<b>isAccept</b>

<p>
Just as in Prom Week, actions can be tied to games either be 'accepted' or 'rejected' i.e., I ask you out on a date, and if you accept the social game then we'll have one set of effects/instantiations to choose from, and if you reject it then you'll have another set to draw on.

<p>
The way that *I believe* isAccept works in cif.js (and I should review this, because I don't know how thoroughly we tested it) is that at any action (be it terminal or non-terminal) you can say whether it is an isAccept or not (true means accept, false means reject). If the responder's volition at that point is negative (i.e. they are planning on rejecting), then it won't consider the action possible UNLESS it is a reject game, and vice versa for if the responder has a positive volition score.

<p>
If no isAccept field is defined, I *believe* it defaults to isAccept: true. But if I discover that I'm misquoting that, I'll let you know.

<p>
AND... there you go! Hopefully that should set you off on the path to becoming an action expert.

<p>
Good luck!

<h3>The End (For Now)</h3>

This is just scratching the surface of the capabilities of CiF. However, hopefully this has provided you, gentle reader, with an understanding of how to integrate CiF into your project, and some of the key functions that you'll likely be calling again and again in your main game loop.

Additional tutorials and sample games are in the works, but for now, have fun making dynamic social worlds!
