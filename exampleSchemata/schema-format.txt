A CiF schema is a set of files defining a social world.

A schema's files should exist within their own directory. They should be .json files containing a dictionary of objects. The dictionary requires several keys as specified below: these can be 

	schema.json
		This file defines the social classes and types of your simulation.

	cast.json (optional)
		This file defines a cast of characters.

	history.json (optional)
		This optional file populates the social history with past events. When loaded, the timestep will be advanced to the latest time specified in the history file.

	various rule files (see below)

A schema should also have files defining trigger rules and volition rules, as well as possibly other kinds of rules. You can split your rules into as many files as you like. Each one should include keys "type" and "fileName" to help identify them.
